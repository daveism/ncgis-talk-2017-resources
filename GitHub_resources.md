### Data

 [Source Map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7a1f7ebd8d7f429b94335e8890561c4d)
 Source map.  A source map that I created and shared with everyone

Source Data I created and shared with everyone for getting field names

Note: Data can be anything on ArcGIS Online (AGOL) and could be published from anyone. Like your favorite City or Organization. In this case it's [NEMAC](https://nemac.unca.edu/).

### Convenience
[ArcGIS Online My Content](http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html)
If you're logged into ArcGIS Online (AGOL) go straight to my content page.  Because I never seem to go straight there and sometimes the link to my content is not available.
