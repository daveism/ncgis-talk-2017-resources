### Data

 [Source Map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7a1f7ebd8d7f429b94335e8890561c4d) - A source map that I created and shared with everyone.

 
[Source Layer](http://services1.arcgis.com/PwLrOgCfU0cYShcG/arcgis/rest/services/wnc_fires_2016/FeatureServer/1) - Source data I created and shared with everyone. I use the source data to copy and paste field names into map viewer configuration files.

Note: You can use any web map published on ArcGIS Online (AGOL), like a web map published by your favorite city or organization. In this case, it's [NEMAC](https://nemac.unca.edu/).

### Convenience
[ArcGIS Online My Content](http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html) - Use this link to go straight to the "my content" page when you're logged into AGOL. For some reason, every time I need to get to my content, the link is not available.

### Things for Copying and Pasting
