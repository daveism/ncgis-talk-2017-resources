# Step 3: Fork a viewer

After completing [Step 2](GitHub_step2.md), we start the process of creating our website! To do this, we need to [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) or copy all of the code to a new [GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository).  The new repository authorizes us to make [commits](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit) or changes.


We are going to use an [ESRI](http://www.esri.com/) map viewer template.  

Search  **ArcGIS Online (AGOL)**  for the Summary Map Viewer. 

Click on the Viewer.

Click on Download.

![Fork](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIcFBlR2F4QkQtRUU)

This will take you to the GitHub repository for the Summary Map Viewer.

Fork it.
