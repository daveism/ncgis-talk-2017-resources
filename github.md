A step-by-step guide to creating your very own [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com) map viewer hosted on GitHub. This can be done in under 15 minutes at very low cost :moneybag: (aka $0).  In fact I can demo the process in under 10! :thumbsup: :100: :punch:

## Scenario 
You have the need to create a customized map viewer using [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com).  
You have access to no servers.  
You have no budget. 

## Assumption 
This assumes you either (i) have an account or (ii) have the ability to create an account to [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com) and :octocat: [GitHub](https://github.com/). Both of which can be free.
