If you're logged into ArcGIS Online (AGOL) go straight to my content page.  Because I never seem to go straight there and sometimes the link to my content is not available.

[Got to Step 1](GitHub_step1.md)


# Step 2: Share the map

WNC Fires 2016 should now be listed in your [content](http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section of ArcGIS Online.

Open the web map in ArcGIS Online.

Share the map with Everyone. Note: For a GitHub hosted application this is required.

> Make a note about webmap id your going to need it later

![share](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvITHBReHBleFI4SHc)

# Step 3: Fork a viewer

We are going to use an ESRI template.  

Search ArcGIS Online for the Summary Map Viewer 

Click on the Viewer.

Click on Download.

This will take you to the GitHub Repostory for the Summary Map Viewer.

Fork it.

![Fork](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIMlhON0luLUZtdWs)

# Step 4: Rename the "repository"

On GitHub in the forked repository go to settings


![Settings](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIU0hBWE52ZTBjWUE)


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rename text box type `WNC Fires 2016`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then click `rename`

![rename](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIcjBCVFlqZUlsZzg)


# Step 3: Magic

GitHub Pages

On GitHub go to settings

![Settings](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIU0hBWE52ZTBjWUE)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the select source to `master branch` then click `save`

Wait a few moments... refresh the browser.

When the background of the url just under the GitHub pages section turns green it's ready.  

Click the url and see the magic.

![Settings](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIdzF1NWJFbzBOZ1E)


# Step 4: Configure the viewer

Replace the file with the `config/default.js` with the contents of 
[config/default.js](https://gist.github.com/daveism/f05a1c146d9d3f41e31efb0757e7dfce)


or just edit the stuff that changed
[config/default.js changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/f05a1c146d9d3f41e31efb0757e7dfce/revisions)


![Settings](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0BykF_bN9fsvIRWtYdlJQaWxoNnM)

Do a hard refresh in your browser.


# Note

**No servers**

**No cost**


# Step 5: Customize
> Once  you customize a viewer, the viewer can no longer live on ArcGIS online. 
> You need a place to host it.


Let's change the viewer so the messages about count and sum are more accurate.

Replace the file `js/main.js` with the contents of 
[js/main.js](https://gist.github.com/daveism/981289ab2730a7f1f148e6b991ef7020)

or just edit the stuff that changed
[js/main.js changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/981289ab2730a7f1f148e6b991ef7020/revisions)

# Step 6: Customize the look to match your branding


add this [line](https://gist.github.com/daveism/9d02902697ffc62f4ccc4f67b7ce011e#file-ncgis-2017-index-no-dns-html-L16) to ```index.html```

just replace the whole file ```css/main.css``` with this [file](https://gist.github.com/daveism/aa4af8c979021671d9ec6ab37d729a60)


Change the color scheme to #5091B2 in ```config/deafualt.js```

# Note

**Still No servers**

**Still No cost**

# Step 7: Using your Domain or Subdomain

Okay you caught me.  You might have to pay a few dollars, if you buy a domain. And you might need I.T.'s help. But it's easy I promise.


On GitHub go to settings >

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look for section - `Custom Domain` 
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Custom Domain text box add the text for a subdomain.  I am using `wncfires2016.nemac.org`
 
 > of course for your site, the `nemac.org` will change
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;click `save`

There should be a new file in your repository named `CNAME`.  It contains the text you entered as a subdomain `wncfires2016.nemac.org`.

Add a cname record according to DNS providers directions.  There are just too many providers to go over each one.  Here is an example of what the cname looks like using Amazons Route 53.


Finally, the viewer has some hardcoding we need fix it change this:

- [new code](https://gist.github.com/daveism/d9d2cf2d34c5ee9b540ec5ca8abf4dab/revisions)

no go to the URL in my case it's http://wncfires2016.nemac.org/

# Note

**Still No servers**

**Maybe some minimal cost**
