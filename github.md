#### Step 3: Fork a viewer

```
We are going to use an ESRI template.  
Either find it in ArcGIS online. 
```


```
or fork it directly in GitHub
```
[Summary Viewer](https://github.com/Esri/summary-viewer-template)


```
Rename the viewer:  WNC Fires 2016 
On GitHub go to settings, rename it, then click rename
```

#### Step 3: Say the magic words GitHub Pages

```
On GitHub scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
Change the select source to master branch save
```

```
Wait a few moments
```

```
When the url turns green it's ready.  Click and see the magic.
```

#### Step 4: Configure the viewer

```
change the config/default.js to match the following file:
you can copy and paste the entire thing
```

[Config changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/64c30b371a055f18bd20c52557d51d3a)

```
or just the stuff that changed
```



```
Do a hard refresh in your browser.
```

## Note to self

**No servers**

**No cost**

##

#### Step 5: Customize
> Once  you customize a viewer, the viewer can no longer live on ArcGIS online. 

```
You need a place to host it.
```

```
Let's change the viewer so the messages about count and acres actuall tell the user what we want them to know!  Where are working with js/main.js
```

https://gist.github.com/daveism/41a800fa6b7a1813ea621148dfa453d5#file-ncgis-2017-main-js-L334

```
and
```


https://gist.github.com/daveism/41a800fa6b7a1813ea621148dfa453d5#file-ncgis-2017-main-js-L344

```
then
```

```
then
```


```
or just replace the file with this one:
```
[main.js changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/41a800fa6b7a1813ea621148dfa453d5)


#### Step 6: Customize the look to match your branding

```
add this line to index.html
```

[index.html changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/9d02902697ffc62f4ccc4f67b7ce011e#file-ncgis-2017-index-no-dns-html-L16)

```
just replace the whole file css/main.css with this one:
```

[CSS changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/aa4af8c979021671d9ec6ab37d729a60)


#### Step 7: Using your own URL

okay you caught me.  Yu might have to pay a few dollars here and you might need I.T.'s help. But it's easy I promise.


```
On GitHub got to the settings and scroll to the GitHub Pages section
look for Custom domain
in the blank box add a subdomain for me it's wncfires2016.nemac.org
click save
```

There should be a new file named CNAME.  It contains the text you entered as a subdomain.

The viewer has some hardcoding in it we need change the line
