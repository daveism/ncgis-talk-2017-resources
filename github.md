## No It needed. (Dude where's my server)

#### Step 1: Log into ArcGIS Online borrow a map and save it
```
For this example use this map at the URL below and do a save as WNC Fires 2016
```
[Source Map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7a1f7ebd8d7f429b94335e8890561c4d)

_this save's the map into your ArcGIS Online account._


#### Step 2: The map, WNC Fires 2016 should now be listed in your my content section
```
Make a note about webmap id
Click on details and when the map opens copy the web id.
Also it might help to have information about the data in the map.  You may need this later to customize the viewer.
```

[Source Layer](http://services1.arcgis.com/PwLrOgCfU0cYShcG/arcgis/rest/services/wnc_fires_2016/FeatureServer/1)

#### Step 3: Fork a viewer

```
We are going to use an ESRI template.  
Either find it in ArcGIS online. 
```


```
or fork it directly in GitHub
```
[Summary Viewer](https://github.com/Esri/summary-viewer-template)


```
Rename the viewer:  WNC Fires 2016 
On GitHub go to settings, rename it, then click rename
```

#### Step 3: Say the magic words GitHub Pages

```
On GitHub scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
Change the select source to master branch save
```

```
Wait a few moments
```

```
When the url turns green it's ready.  Click and see the magic.
```

#### Step 4: Configure the viewer

```
change the config/default.js to match the following file:
you can copy and paste the entire thing
```

```
or just the stuff that changed
```



```
Do a hard refresh in your browser.
```

## Note to self

**No servers**

**No cost**

##

#### Step 5: Customize
> Once  you customize a viewer, the viewer can no longer live on ArcGIS online. 

```
You need a place to host it.
```

```
Let's change the viewer so the messages about count and acres actuall tell the user what we want them to know! 
```

and
https://gist.github.com/daveism/41a800fa6b7a1813ea621148dfa453d5#file-ncgis-2017-main-js-L344

```
then
```


[main.js changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/41a800fa6b7a1813ea621148dfa453d5)


#### Step 6: Customize look and feel

```
add this line to index.html
```

[index.html changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/9d02902697ffc62f4ccc4f67b7ce011e#file-ncgis-2017-index-no-dns-html-L16)

```
just replace the whole file css/main.css with this one:
```

#### Step 7: Using your own URL

okay you caught me you might have to pay a few dollars here and you might need it's help. But it's easy I promise.


My example.

```
On GitHub got to the settings and scroll to the GitHub Pages section
look for Custom domain
in the blank box add a subdomain for me it's wncfires2016.nemac.org
click save
```

There should be a new file named CNAME.  It contains the text you entered as a subdomain.

The viewer has some hardcoding in it we need change the line
