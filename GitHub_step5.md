# Step 5: Customize

After [step 4](GitHub_step4.md) is complete we will start to customize the map viewer.

> Once  you customize a viewer, the viewer can no longer live on ArcGIS online. 
> You need a place to host it.


Let's change the viewer so the messages about count and sum are more accurate.

Replace the file `js/main.js` with the contents of 
[js/main.js](https://gist.github.com/daveism/981289ab2730a7f1f148e6b991ef7020)

or just edit the stuff that changed
[js/main.js changes](https://gist.github.com/daveism/981289ab2730a7f1f148e6b991ef7020/revisions)
