# Step 2: Share the map

Afer you "borrow" a map you need to share it with everyone!  Since GitHub is not a server you have configuration access to.  The  **ArcGIS Online (AGOL)**  map will need to provide access to everyone for the viewer to work properly

After [step 1](GitHub_step1.md) is comple WNC Fires 2016 should now be listed in your [content](http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section of ArcGIS Online.

Open the web map in ArcGIS Online.

Share the map with Everyone. Note: For a GitHub hosted application this is required.

> Make a note about webmap id your going to need it later
