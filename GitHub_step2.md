# Step 2: Share the map

After you "borrow" a map in [step 1](GitHub_step1.md), you need to share it with everyone for the map viewer to work. The web map "WNC Fires 2016" will be listed in my [content](http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section of AGOL.

Open the web map in AGOL (in a new window if you think about it).

Share the map with everyone.

> Tip: Keep the web map window open. You're going to need some information from it later!
