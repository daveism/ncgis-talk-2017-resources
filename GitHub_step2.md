# Step 2: Share the map

Afer you "borrow" a map, you will need to share it with everyone!  The  **ArcGIS Online (AGOL)**  map will need to provide access to everyone for the viewer to work properly

After [step 1](GitHub_step1.md) is comple WNC Fires 2016 will be listed in the my [content](http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section of AGOL.

Open the web map in AGOL (in a new window if you think about it).

Share the map with Everyone.

> Tip: keep this window open your going to need the webmap later!
